# üî¥ CRITICAL FIX NEEDED

## The Problem
Your Netlify deployment doesn't have the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable set!

## Current Situation
- Vercel logs show: `404 for /auth/login`
- This means the frontend is NOT connecting to your backend
- The frontend is probably using localhost or an empty URL

## The Solution - Add Environment Variable in Netlify

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com
   - Click on your site: `taskmanagementsystemabyasad`

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
   - Click on "Site settings" (left sidebar)
   - Click on "Environment variables" (in the Build & deploy section)

3. **Add New Environment Variable**
   - Click "Add variable" or "Add environment variable"
   - **Key:** `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://task-management-backend-1-tau.vercel.app/api`
   - Select: All environments (or just Production)
   - Click "Save"

4. **Redeploy Your Site**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Find the latest deployment
   - Click the 3 dots (...) menu
   - Click "Trigger deploy"
   - Select "Redeploy site"

5. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Watch the deployment logs
   - Wait for "Published" status

6. **Test Login**
   - Go to: https://taskmanagementsystemabyasad.netlify.app/login
   - Email: `admin@taskmgmt.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123`

## Expected Result
After adding the environment variable and redeploying:
- Frontend will call: `https://task-management-backend-1-tau.vercel.app/api/auth/login`
- Login should work successfully! ‚úÖ

## Why This Happened
When `REACT_APP_API_URL` is not set, the frontend uses the fallback value from `api.js`:
```javascript
const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api';
```

Since `localhost` doesn't exist on Netlify, all API calls fail!

## Summary
‚úÖ **Backend:** Working on Vercel  
‚úÖ **Database:** Connected and working  
‚úÖ **Admin User:** Created successfully  
‚ùå **Frontend Environment Variable:** NOT SET  
‚úÖ **Frontend Code:** Ready to deploy

**After setting the environment variable, everything will work!** üéâ
