# Frontend-Backend Connection Setup Complete! ‚úÖ

## What I've Done

1. ‚úÖ **Updated API Configuration**
   - Modified `frontend/src/services/api.js` to use environment variables
   - Now reads from `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable

2. ‚úÖ **Created Environment File**
   - Created `.env` file in the frontend folder
   - Set API URL to: `https://task-management-backend-1-tau.vercel.app/api`

3. ‚úÖ **Ready to Use**
   - All your service files (authService, taskService, userService) are already properly configured
   - Frontend is ready to connect to your deployed backend

## Backend Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Required**: Your backend needs environment variables to work properly

See `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` for instructions on how to:
- Add MongoDB connection string
- Add JWT secret
- Redeploy the backend

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Backend (Important!)
Follow the instructions in `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` to add environment variables in Vercel and redeploy.

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test Connection
Once the backend is working:
1. The frontend will automatically connect to: `https://task-management-backend-1-tau.vercel.app/api`
2. You can login with your admin credentials
3. All features will work:
   - Task management (CRUD operations)
   - User management (Admin can create managers and users)
   - Task statistics
   - Search and filtering

## API Endpoints Available

All these endpoints are configured in your frontend:

### Authentication
- Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- Get Current User: `GET /api/auth/me`
- Create Admin: `POST /api/auth/create-admin`

### Tasks
- Get All Tasks: `GET /api/tasks`
- Get Task Stats: `GET /api/tasks/stats`
- Create Task: `POST /api/tasks`
- Get Task: `GET /api/tasks/:id`
- Update Task: `PUT /api/tasks/:id`
- Delete Task: `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`

### Users
- Create Manager: `POST /api/users/managers` (Admin only)
- Get All Managers: `GET /api/users/managers` (Admin only)
- Create Regular User: `POST /api/users/regular-users` (Admin/Manager)
- Get All Users: `GET /api/users/regular-users`
- Assign Manager: `PUT /api/users/assign-manager` (Admin only)
- Delete User: `DELETE /api/users/:id` (Admin only)

## Summary

‚úÖ Frontend is configured to connect to your Vercel backend  
‚ö†Ô∏è Backend needs environment variables (see VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md)  
‚úÖ All endpoints are properly set up in services  
‚úÖ Ready to start coding once backend is working

Good luck! üöÄ
